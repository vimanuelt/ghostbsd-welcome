<big>Getting help</big>

Although GhostBSD is designed to work as much "out of the box" as possible, we don't claim it's perfect. There can be times when things go wrong, you might have questions and a desire to learn more or just want to personalise it to suit your tastes. This page provides details of some available resources to help you!

<b>Search the web</b>

Perhaps the first place to look for generic GhostBSD help is by using your favourite search engine. Just include words like 'FreeBSD', 'TrueOS' or 'GhostBSD' in your search query.

As GhostBSD is based on TrueOS, guides and tips designed for TrueOS usually apply to GhostBSD too.

<b>Look in the forums</b>

For specific help with GhostBSD we have a dedicated online forum where you can search for topics, or create one yourself! This is probably the next best place to go for collaboration, discussion and assistance. Ask for help, post your thoughts, or outline some suggestions. Don't be shy!

The GhostBSD forum is divided into sub-forums for different topics and environments, please post your query in the appropriate place!

<b>Join us on IRC (Internet Relay Chat)</b>

Another option is to join us on IRC by joining our #ghostbsd channel on the chat.freenode.net servers.

<big>Suggestions</big>

Got a suggestion on how we can make GhostBSD better? Found something you want included, or want to help out? Please let us know, by posting your suggestion on the forum, drop by on IRC, or visit us on Telegram.

Thank you!

We hope you enjoy using GhostBSD!
