<big>GhostBSD 18</big>

We are happy to publish another stable release of GhostBSD.

The MATE Desktop Environment edition remains our flagship offering and has received the attention it deserves. Few can claim to offer such a polished, integrated and leading-edge MATE experience. We ship MATE 1.20 with this release of GhostBSD. We mainly focused on polishing the user experience on the desktop and window manager, and on updating some components to take advantage of newly available technologies.

We hope you enjoy this release and let us know what you think of GhostBSD.
